  <h4 align="center">Phishing tool for Instagram, cloaked as NGL - Anonymous questions link app 😬</h4>
</h3>

## What is this tool?

NGL+, also known as Nefariously Generated Links, presents itself as an extension of the NGL.LINK app, a platform where users can create links to receive anonymous messages from their Instagram followers. However, this seemingly innocent facade conceals a phishing tool designed to exploit its user's victims trust. NGL+ operates under the guise of the NGL.LINK app, leveraging the familiar interface to lure its user's followers into a false sense of security. What sets NGL+ apart is its nefarious use of phishing techniques. Unlike the authentic NGL.LINK, NGL+ has the capability to deceive its user's followers into submitting their Instagram login information. This deceptive method allows the apps users to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. 😈🔗

## How To Use:

1. Visit the NGL+ signup page and enter your Instagram username: [NGL+ Signup Page](https://ngliink.web.app/signup.html) 🔗
2. Click the profile picture and change it to the one belonging to your Instagram profile. 📷
3. Click **copy link** to copy your phishing link to your clipboard.👆
4. Click **Share!** to automatically create an IG story post (looks identical to the NGL one) and then open it in Instagram. 📸

## How to post on IG story:

1. Scale the screenshot so it looks normal on your IG story. 🤏
2. Click the sticker button on Instagram then find **🔗 LINK**.
3. Paste your phishing link in the textbox. 📝
4. Click **Customize sticker text** 👆
5. Enter **NGL.LINK** or something similar. 🔗
6. Place the link sticker on top of the placeholder that says "Paste your link here" & completely cover it. 🙌
7. Share your story, and await user responses. ⏳
